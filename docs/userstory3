As a reddit logged in user, I want to be able to view my toxicity data in a clean, 
easy-to-use format so that I can understand how other people on reddit may perceive me.

What this covers:
Working in conjunction with User Stories 1 and 2, and if everything goes right, 
the user will be able to log in using their reddit credentials, and immediately be presented with a tabulated view of their toxicity data 
organized by different “toxic” categories and the percentage of how much the user exhibits these characteristics online. 
The different categories will be: “hate”, “hate/threatening”, “self-harm”, “sexual”, “sexual/minors”, “violence”, “violence/graphics”. 
By providing these characteristics in a clean, easy to understand format, the user will not feel overwhelmed by the data our app presents and 
will help them understand their “weaknesses” and work to improve on them.
