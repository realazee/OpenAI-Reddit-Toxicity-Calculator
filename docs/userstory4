As a logged in user, I want to know how I can improve my toxicity score overtime. 

What this covers:
Similar to what many banks such as Chase and Bank of America offer, we could break down the categories and how we rate the userâ€™s toxicity score. 
We could then give suggestions to users on how to improve their online behavior and reduce their toxicity score. 
This could include tips on using more positive language, avoiding controversial topics, and engaging in constructive discussions with other users. 
Or if the user is doing well and is not engaging in the toxic behavior online on reddit, 
the app will congratulate them and provide the user with general tips on how they can continue with this trend.
