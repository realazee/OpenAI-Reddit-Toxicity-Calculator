Story: As a reddit logged in user. I might want to view my online toxicity as a credit score-like score, 
so I can estimate the perception of me as an online user. 

What this covers:
If everything goes right, the user should be able to login to the app through their reddit account, 
then immediately see a numerical score on the home page, rating how toxic they might be on the internet, reddit specifically. 
The score will be calculated based on their “toxicity” ratings in different categories which will be discussed in further detail later. 
The score could be categorized into different ranges such as "excellent", "good", "fair", "poor", and "extremely poor".
Each range would be associated with a numerical score, and users would be able to see which range they fall into based on their online behavior. 

If the user cannot view their score, then they need to login again for the score to appear.

Overall, the goal of this app would be to encourage users to be more mindful of their online behavior and strive to create a more positive and 
welcoming online community.
